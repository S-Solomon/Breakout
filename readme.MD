# Breakout game clone

## Pre Design Step
- The goal of this game project is to destroy all the bricks on the screen by bouncing
a ball off a paddle.

- Essential features the game should have are:
  - Paddle control
  - Ball movement
  - Brick destruction
  - Scoring system
  - Levels
  - Game over conditions
  - Multiple levels with increasing difficulty
  - Different types of bricks with varying properties
  - Power ups
  - Sound effect
  

- Pertaining the user journey and cognitive load, there should be intuitive controls with responsive
paddle movement and clear instructions. We should gradually introduce game mechanics, avoid overwhelming the player with too many elements, 
and guide the player through the game's progression.
